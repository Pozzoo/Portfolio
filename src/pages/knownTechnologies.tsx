            <p>I'm mainly a Java developer, but I love to learn new languages and skills! Currently im well familiar
                with the Java language, as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As my main tools I use Intellij IDEA,
                NetBeans, VSCode and Git. Currently I'm learning C++ and soon I want to try C#. Although it isn't tech
                related it's good to mention that im fluent in both Portuguese and English.</p>
